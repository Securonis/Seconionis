# Seconionis
Seconionis is a privacy tool developed for Securonis GNU/Linux. It forces all network traffic through the Tor network and aims to prevent data leaks through additional system configurations. It also provides features such as MAC address spoofing, running as a Systemd service, and trace cleaning.
The traffic redirection to the Tor network is implemented using a Bash script, while the graphical user interface (GUI) is developed with Python and PyQt5.
